# Sensor Fusion and Tracking

This is the project for the second course in the  [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213) : Sensor Fusion and Tracking. 

In this project, I fuse measurements from LiDAR and camera and track vehicles over time. I use real-world data from the Waymo Open Dataset, detect objects in 3D point clouds and apply an extended Kalman filter for sensor fusion and tracking.

The project consists of two major parts: 
1. **Object detection**: In this part, a deep-learning approach is used to detect vehicles in LiDAR data based on a birds-eye view perspective of the 3D point-cloud. Also, a series of performance measures is used to evaluate the performance of the detection approach. 
2. **Object tracking** : In this part, an extended Kalman filter is used to track vehicles over time, based on the lidar detections fused with camera detections. Data association and track management are implemented as well.

The following diagram contains an outline of the data flow and of the individual steps that make up the algorithm.

Also, the project code contains various tasks, which are detailed step-by-step in the code. More information on the algorithm and on the tasks can be found in the Udacity classroom.

## Installation Instructions for Running Locally
### Cloning the Project
In order to create a local copy of the project, please click on "Code" and then "Download ZIP". Alternatively, you may of-course use GitHub Desktop or Git Bash for this purpose. 

### Docker container
All dependencies required for the project are installed with the docker build. An nvidia GPU is required. To build the container use:
`docker_build.sh` script.

### Waymo Open Dataset Reader
The Waymo Open Dataset Reader is a very convenient toolbox that allows you to access sequences from the Waymo Open Dataset without the need of installing all of the heavy-weight dependencies that come along with the official toolbox. The installation instructions can be found in `tools/waymo_reader/README.md`. 

### Waymo Open Dataset Files
This project makes use of three different sequences to illustrate the concepts of object detection and tracking. These are: 
- Sequence 1 : `training_segment-1005081002024129653_5313_150_5333_150_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 2 : `training_segment-10072231702153043603_5725_000_5745_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`
- Sequence 3 : `training_segment-10963653239323173269_1924_000_1944_000_with_camera_labels.tfrecord`

To download these files, you will have to register with Waymo Open Dataset first: [Open Dataset – Waymo](https://waymo.com/open/terms), if you have not already, making sure to note "Udacity" as your institution.

Once you have done so, please [click here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files) to access the Google Cloud Container that holds all the sequences. Once you have been cleared for access by Waymo (which might take up to 48 hours), you can download the individual sequences. 

The sequences listed above can be found in the folder "training". Please download them and put the `tfrecord`-files into the `dataset` folder of this project.


### Pre-Trained Models
The object detection methods used in this project use pre-trained models which have been provided by the original authors. They can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pqx7sShlqKSGmvshTYbNDcUEYyZwfn3A/view?usp=sharing) (darknet) and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RcEfUIF1pzDZco8PJkZ10OL-wLL2usEj/view?usp=sharing) (fpn_resnet). Once downloaded, please copy the model files into the paths `/tools/objdet_models/darknet/pretrained` and `/tools/objdet_models/fpn_resnet/pretrained` respectively.

### Using Pre-Computed Results

In the main file `loop_over_dataset.py`, you can choose which steps of the algorithm should be executed. If you want to call a specific function, you simply need to add the corresponding string literal to one of the following lists: 

- `exec_data` : controls the execution of steps related to sensor data. 
  - `pcl_from_rangeimage` transforms the Waymo Open Data range image into a 3D point-cloud
  - `load_image` returns the image of the front camera

- `exec_detection` : controls which steps of model-based 3D object detection are performed
  - `bev_from_pcl` transforms the point-cloud into a fixed-size birds-eye view perspective
  - `detect_objects` executes the actual detection and returns a set of objects (only vehicles) 
  - `validate_object_labels` decides which ground-truth labels should be considered (e.g. based on difficulty or visibility)
  - `measure_detection_performance` contains methods to evaluate detection performance for a single frame

In case you do not include a specific step into the list, pre-computed binary files will be loaded instead. This enables you to run the algorithm and look at the results even without having implemented anything yet. The pre-computed results for the mid-term project need to be loaded using [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-s46dKSrtx8rrNwnObGbly2nO3i4D7r7?usp=sharing) link. Please use the folder `darknet` first. Unzip the file within and put its content into the folder `results`.

- `exec_tracking` : controls the execution of the object tracking algorithm

- `exec_visualization` : controls the visualization of results
  - `show_range_image` displays two LiDAR range image channels (range and intensity)
  - `show_labels_in_image` projects ground-truth boxes into the front camera image
  - `show_objects_and_labels_in_bev` projects detected objects and label boxes into the birds-eye view
  - `show_objects_in_bev_labels_in_camera` displays a stacked view with labels inside the camera image on top and the birds-eye view with detected objects on the bottom
  - `show_tracks` displays the tracking results
  - `show_detection_performance` displays the performance evaluation based on all detected 
  - `make_tracking_movie` renders an output movie of the object tracking results

Even without solving any of the tasks, the project code can be executed. 

The final project uses pre-computed lidar detections in order for all students to have the same input data. If you use the workspace, the data is prepared there already. Otherwise, [download the pre-computed lidar detections](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IkqFGYTF6Fh_d8J3UjQOSNJ2V42UDZpO?usp=sharing) (~1 GB), unzip them and put them in the folder `results`.

## Identifying vehicle features that appear as a stable feature on most vehicles and describing them briefly.

Most vehicles captured in the point cloud resemble a sedan. Therefore the shape of the vehicle is apparent in the point cloud.

The point captures the shape of the vehicles including the left and right external mirrors.

Sometimes the front and back windshields are also apparent which seems to be due to the lidar's weak reflection across the windows.

Looking at the vehicles from the side, the windows are also apparent as well as the tires. The front and rear bumper shapes and well as the top and sides of the vehicle appear to be the most stable features

##  Tracking Final Write up
-Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (EKF, track management, data association, camera-lidar sensor fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?

The first tracking step is EKF. This was single object tracking but was the foundation of the multi-object tracking. Here we learned how to construct the system matrix and the covariance matrix. Then we performed updates on the system state according to the lidar measurements. We acheived our RMSE goals indicating the tracking is functional.
<img src="img/track_part1.png"/>

The second step was track management. This step still assumes single objects, but is required for multiple objects. Track managment starts from initializing a track and setting a state for the track, if the system is confident is detected a vehicle over a sequence of images it will place the vehicle is a confirmed state. If the system doesn't consistently detect the vehicle over successive frames it may place the vehicle in the "tentative" state. Here we were able to observe an object get detected and detection gets increasingly confident over a few frames.
<img src="img/track_part2.png"/>

For Multiobject tracking we start with data association and mapping each measurement with the nearest neighbor track. We successfully tracked multiple object with low RMSE.
<img src="img/track_part3.png"/>

Lastly the camera-lidar sensor fusion allowed us to add redudancy to our tracking. Since Lidar is good at detecting volume of objects camera is good at knowing what those objects are. We did see improvements in avoiding false detections with camera. 
<img src="img/track_part4.png"/>

-Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)?
The amount of improvements we seen is less than expected. In theory the camera is a supplemental sensor which should be certain of false detections. In practice we were still seeing false detections which is due to a lack of tuning.

-Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?
The challenges the sensor fusion system will face is proper calibration and syncrhonization of the sensors. The project did face these challenges as the tracking isn't precise.

-Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
Tracking can be improved by tuning the parameters more and better calibrating the sensors.

The most difficult part of the project is the first step. The EKF is at the heart of the tracking and is the most complex part. It takes take to be familiar with the linear algebra behind the EKF.

## Stand out
Fine-tune your parameterization and see how low an RMSE you can achieve! One idea would be to apply the standard deviation values for lidar that you found in the mid-term project. The parameters in misc/params.py should enable a first running tracking, but there is still a lot of room for improvement through parameter tuning!
Implement a more advanced data association, e.g. Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) or Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA).
Feed your camera detections from Project 1 to the tracking.
Adapt the Kalman filter to also estimate the object's width, length, and height, instead of simply using the unfiltered lidar detections as we did.
Use a non-linear motion model, e.g. a bicycle model, which is more appropriate for vehicle movement than our linear motion model, since a vehicle can only move forward or backward, not in any direction.
